Introduction
------------

*mfabrik.zoho* package provides Python classes for making easy Zoho API calls.
They allow you to integrate `Zoho web application data <http://www.zoho.com>`
into your Python software.

Features
--------

* Creating Zoho API session a.k.a ticket

* Extendable API using a base class architecture

* Logging all incoming and outgoing API traffic with Zoho

* Support Python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 (2.4 needs additional lxml and simplejson libraries installed)

* Compatible with non-ASCII or Unicode letters

* Unit tests to guarantee the high quality of the code

*mfabrik.zoho* is intended to use for machine-to-machine communication and
will work with any web framework, like Plone, Django, Google App Engine.

To communicate with Zoho you need username, password or API KEY.
For further information, see *Setup > Admin > Developer key* in
your Zoho application.

API support
-----------

Currently out of box support includes:

* CRM apis: insert_records, get_records, delete_lead
* Support API: add_records

You can easily wrap Zoho API calls you need using this library.
Please contribute patches to the package.

Installation
------------

To install mfabrik.zoho to your system-wide Python
do as below.

Example (UNIX):

    sudo easy_install mfabrik.zoho

Example (UNIX, Python 2.4):

    sudo easy_install mfabrik.zoho lxml simplejson

Usage
-----

To learn how to use this library, it is best to study its unit test source code (tests.py).

Example usage:

```python
# Import CRM connector class for Zoho CRM
from mfabrik.zoho.crm import CRM
# Import Support connector class for Zoho Support
from mfabrik.zoho.crm import SUPPORT
# (optional) Use to raise a ZohoException in your application.
from mfabrik.zoho.core import ZohoException

# Initialize Zoho CRM API connection
# You need valid Zoho API key for this.
# You get necessary data from Zoho > Setup > Admin > Developer key
crm = CRM(authtoken="authtoken", scope="crmapi")
# same for support
support = SUPPORT(authtoken="authtoken", scope="supportapi")

# If you're going to use session tickets, include a username and password
# Then run MODULE.open() to generate the session ticket.
# This functionality is currently Deprecated for CRM & Support and will cause a 4500 error
# It might be available with other Zoho API's
crm = CRM(username="myusername", password="foobar", authtoken="12312312312312312323", scope="crmapi")
crm.open()
```

CRM input example::

```python
# Input is just a bunch of dictionaried data
# For possible parameters see https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/api/insertrecords.html
# To discover required fields in CRM, log into zoho and visit Setup > Customization > Layouts
# Everything marked with red, or with a padlock is a required field.

# Zoho default compulsory fields for Leads: Last Name, Company

lead = {
    u"First Name" : u"Mikko",
    u"Last Name" : u"Ohtamaa",
    u"Company" : u"mFabrik Research Oy"
}
# Special fields *Lead Owner* must be the Email of the CRM user.

# Insert a new lead to Zoho CRM lead database.
# We support multiple leads per call, so we need to listify our one lead first.
responses = crm.insert_records('Leads',[lead]) # This will raise ZohoException if lead data is invalid

# To insert records attached to a parent record, like a Product on a SalesOrder
# This functionality is currently only written for the CRM.
SalesOrders = {
    'Subject': "Subjuct is required", # Subject is required
    'Sales Order Owner': "you@youremail.com", # Must be the registered Email for the CRM user
    'Contact Name': Zoho ID from either Leads, Contacts, OR a string containing the Full Contact Name.
    'Sub Total': "100",
    'Tax': "5",
    'Adjustment':"5",
    'Grand Total': "110",
    'Billing Street': "123 Fake Street",
    'Shipping Street': "123 Fake Street",
    'Billing City': "San Francisco",
    'Shipping City': "San Francisco",
    'Billing State': "CA",
    'Shipping State': "CA",
    'Billing Code': "90001",
    'Shipping Code': "90001",
    'Billing Country': "US",
    'Shipping Country': "US",
    'Product Details':{ # Add a For Each, add a list full of dictionaries contaning at least a Product Id
        'product': [
            {
                'Product Id': '1470000001', # The Zoho ID from the item in the "Products" module
                'Product Name': "Foo",
                'Qty': "20",
                'Unit Price': "10",
                'List Price': "10",
                'Total': "200",
                'Discount': "100",
                'Total After Discount':"100",
                'Net Total':"100",
            },
        ],
    },
}
response = crm.insert_records('SalesOrders', [SalesOrders])

# list of responses. one response is {'Modified Time': '2010-10-07 13:24:49', 'Created By': 'Developer', 'Modified By': 'Developer', 'Id': '177376000000253053', 'Created Time': '2010-10-07 13:24:49'}
# At least one response is guaranteed, otherwise an exception is raised

lead_id = responses[0]["Id"]
```

Support input example:
```python
incomingData = {
    'Contact Name': 'John Doe',
    'Email': 'jdoe@example.com',
    'Phone': '555-555-1234',
    'Classification': 'Software Issue',
    'Subject': 'Support request subject here',
    'Description': 'Body of the support request text.'
}
response = support.add_records([incomingData], 'Department Name', 'Portal Name')
record_id = response[0]["Id"]
```

> Some calls (e.g. delete) seem to have delay and the changes might not be instantly
> reflected in the next API call (getRecords).
